# Epic: ®PX |ê¨ (Job Platform)

## Overview
Implementation of a comprehensive job matching platform connecting job seekers with employers for temporary/daily work positions. The system will be built using Laravel backend with Blade/Vue.js frontend, MySQL database, and Docker containerization.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Framework**: Laravel for rapid development with built-in authentication, routing, and ORM
- **Frontend**: Blade templates with Vue.js components for interactive elements
- **Database**: MySQL for reliable relational data storage with proper indexing for search performance
- **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum for API authentication with role-based permissions using spatie/laravel-permission
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for consistent, responsive design
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent development and deployment environment
- **External APIs**: Naver Maps API for location services, KakaoTalk API for notifications

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- Responsive web application optimized for mobile-first experience
- Vue.js components for job search filters, application forms, and real-time updates
- Blade layouts for main page structures and SEO-friendly content
- TailwindCSS for consistent styling and responsive design
- Progressive enhancement for accessibility compliance

### Backend Services
- Laravel MVC architecture with service layer for business logic
- RESTful API endpoints for job listings, applications, and user management
- Role-based access control (job seekers, employers, administrators)
- Database models: Users, Jobs, Applications, Companies, Categories, Locations
- Queue system for handling notifications and email processing
- File upload handling for resumes and company documents

### Infrastructure
- Docker-based development and production environment
- MySQL database with proper indexing for search performance
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Self-hosted deployment with monitoring and logging
- Integration with external APIs (Naver Maps, KakaoTalk notifications)

## Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Core user management and authentication system
- **Phase 2**: Job posting and search functionality
- **Phase 3**: Application and matching system
- **Phase 4**: Administrative dashboard and analytics
- **Phase 5**: External integrations and optimization
- **Testing**: Unit tests for models, feature tests for workflows, browser tests for critical paths
- **Risk Mitigation**: Incremental deployment, database migrations, API rate limiting

## Task Breakdown Preview
High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] User Authentication & Role Management: Laravel Sanctum setup with multi-role system
- [ ] Database Schema & Models: Core entities (Users, Jobs, Applications, Companies)
- [ ] Job Management System: CRUD operations for job postings with search/filtering
- [ ] Application Workflow: Job application submission and tracking system
- [ ] Admin Dashboard: Management interface for users, jobs, and analytics
- [ ] External Integrations: Naver Maps API and KakaoTalk notifications
- [ ] Frontend Development: Responsive UI with Blade/Vue.js components
- [ ] Testing & Quality Assurance: Comprehensive test suite and performance optimization

## Dependencies
- **External Services**: Naver Maps API access, KakaoTalk Business API setup
- **Infrastructure**: MySQL database server, Docker environment setup
- **Third-party Packages**: Laravel packages (Sanctum, Permissions), Vue.js, TailwindCSS
- **Development Tools**: GitHub repository access, Docker configuration

## Success Criteria (Technical)
- **Performance**: Page load times under 3 seconds, search results under 1 second
- **Scalability**: Support for 10,000+ concurrent users, 100,000+ job listings
- **Security**: Secure authentication, input validation, SQL injection prevention
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive design
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design working on all device sizes
- **API Performance**: RESTful endpoints with proper caching and rate limiting
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient queries with proper indexing strategy
