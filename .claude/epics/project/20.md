# Task: Performance Optimization and Scalability

## Description
Optimize application performance for scalability including database query optimization, caching implementation, API rate limiting, and infrastructure improvements to support high concurrent users and large data volumes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- [ ] Redis caching implemented for frequently accessed data
- [ ] API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] Image optimization and CDN preparation
- [ ] Database connection pooling configured
- [ ] Query monitoring and optimization
- [ ] Load testing validation

## Technical Details
- Implement Laravel cache for search results and user data
- Set up Redis for session storage and application cache
- Add database query optimization and monitoring
- Configure API rate limiting with throttling
- Implement image compression and optimization
- Set up database connection pooling
- Add performance monitoring and logging

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 010 (Testing Suite) for performance validation
- [ ] Redis installation and configuration
- [ ] Performance testing tools

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: true (optimization can be done after core features)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Page load times under 3 seconds
- [ ] Search results load under 1 second
- [ ] Caching reduces database load significantly
- [ ] API rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Application handles 1000+ concurrent users
- [ ] Database performance optimized
- [ ] Load testing validates scalability targets
